						<p>It all started with an Apple LCII, Kid Pix on 3.5" floppy and trying to make my brothers laugh. From there, little has changed other than the computer and the software.</p>

						<p>I am an ever-growing lover of all things creative. Designer, Web Developer and up-and-coming app developer. I make tables, work on my car, make music, animate, make small movies. I'm versatile and am always looking to stay on top of the daily-changing landscape of tech and design. Whether that's new styles and trends in the design world, new languages in the coding world or anything in between.</p>

						<p>I'm a well-versed individual of pop-culture, art, gaming, music and general nerdom.</p><p>I never really know a stranger and love getting to know new people and create new things.


					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>
						Being a lover of all things creative, I also have experience in tertiary software which allows me to be a well rounded creative asset. Audio creation and editing, video editing, and a casual photographer, AfterEffects junkie and anything else that tickles my fancy.</p>

						<p>I'm a critical thinker, jokester, open-minded, outgoing and never really know a stranger. I genuinely love people and always approach each project from their perspective, their needs and their vision while adding a bit of me.</p>
						<p>In my "freetime" you'll find me frequenting the nooks and crannies of Atlanta, hanging with friends, trying new food, making something or honing my skills at a hack-a-thon or tech meetup.</p>
						<p>I think we'd have a great time working together and doing some pretty great things. I'm hungry for it and you'd get a dedicated, smart, funny and well-rounded team mate.
						</p>
						<p>Lets see what we can do together.</p>

					      <h3>RUGGED HANDYMAN</h3>
					      <p>I'm an avid DIY-er and love creating.</p><p>Building a desk, bookshelves, reupholstering chairs, painting, etc.<br> I like getting away from the computer at times and getting my hands dirty.</p><p>I'm also a make-shift mechanic with my daily driver project car.<br>I enjoy learning how things work and if they don't, why?</p><p>I love the struggle and trouble shooting to find the answer of a problem.

					      <h3>AUDIO</h3>
					      <p>Being a musician since I was 15 years old, inputs and outputs,<br>composition and frequencies have been a part of my life.</p><p> I'm regularly in headphones in my down time creating in Logic Pro X.<br>Programming synths, uzing my MPD32, battling my 1/2 working mixer inputs, sampling random audio and refining my mastering, I'm still very much in love with music.

					      <h3>CODING</h3>
					      <p>I love many things and 10 months ago discovered my passion for coding and development.</p><p>I regularly attended local meetups to refine my Javascript, web development and app development. Further, I've jumped into Ruby on Rails, Cocoa and starting to learn a bit of Apple's Swift language.</p><p>I continue to grow in this area. I feel it'd be a powerful asset to throw into my melting-pot of goodness.</p><p>I dream of being that all-encompassing creative beast. That one guy who can do it all.

					<p>So, you made it this far. Let's go one more step and meet up. I think we'd have a good time getting to know each other, and who knows, maybe we'll get to make some really great stuff together.</p><p>Plus, I spent $4.88 on this URL so at least grab me a cup of coffee.</p>
