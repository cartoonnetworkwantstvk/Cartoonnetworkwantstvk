						<p>It all started with an Apple LCII, Kid Pix on 3.5" floppy and trying to make my brothers laugh. From there, little has changed other than the computer and the software.</p>

						<p>I am an ever-growing lover of all things creative. Designer, Web Developer and up-and-coming app developer. I make tables, work on my car, make music, animate, make small movies. I'm versatile and am always looking to stay on top of the daily-changing landscape of tech and design. Whether that's new styles and trends in the design world, new languages in the coding world or anything in between.</p>

						<p>I'm a well-versed individual of pop-culture, art, gaming, music and general nerdom.</p><p>I never really know a stranger and love getting to know new people and create new things.


					</div>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>
						Being a lover of all things creative, I also have experience in tertiary software which allows me to be a well rounded creative asset. Audio creation and editing, video editing, and a casual photographer, AfterEffects junkie and anything else that tickles my fancy.</p>

						<p>I'm a critical thinker, jokester, open-minded, outgoing and never really know a stranger. I genuinely love people and always approach each project from their perspective, their needs and their vision while adding a bit of me.</p>
						<p>In my "freetime" you'll find me frequenting the nooks and crannies of Atlanta, hanging with friends, trying new food, making something or honing my skills at a hack-a-thon or tech meetup.</p>
						<p>I think we'd have a great time working together and doing some pretty great things. I'm hungry for it and you'd get a dedicated, smart, funny and well-rounded team mate.
						</p>
						<p>Lets see what we can do together.</p>

					      <h3>RUGGED HANDYMAN</h3>
					      <p>I'm an avid DIY-er and love creating.</p><p>Building a desk, bookshelves, reupholstering chairs, painting, etc. I like getting away from the computer at times and getting my hands dirty.</p><p>I'm also a make-shift mechanic with my daily driver project car.</p><p>I enjoy learning how things work and if they don't, why? And how can I get them working again?</p><p>I love the struggle and that trouble shooting part of problems.

					      <h3>AUDIO</h3>
					      <p>Being a musician since I was 15 years old, inputs and outputs,<br>composition and frequencies have been a part of my life.</p><p> I'm regularly in headphones in my down time creating in Logic Pro X.</p><p>Programming synths, uzing my MPD32, battling my 1/2 working mixer inputs, sampling random audio and refining my mastering, I'm still very much in love with music.

					      <h3>CODING</h3>
					      <p>I love many things and am pretty good at them.</p><p>Coding is a newer venture for me. I've regularly attended local meetups to refine my Javascript and web development. Further, I've jumped into app development and writing with Ruby on Rails, Cocoa, Unity and starting to learn Apple's Swift.</p><p>I continue to grow in this area. I feel it'd be a powerful asset to throw into my melting-pot of goodness.</p><p>I dream of being that all-encompassing creative beast. One guy who can do it all.

					<p>So, you made it this far. Let's go one more step and meet up. I think we'd have a good time getting to know each other, and who knows, maybe we'll get to make some really great stuff together.</p><p>Plus, I spent $4.88 on this URL so at least grab me a cup of coffee.</p>
